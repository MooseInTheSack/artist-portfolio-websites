This is my first website portfolio as 30 days coding challenges.


## How to install/use

In order to get this super fantastic [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) powered template for Artists follow this simple step:

* If you haven't got ruby installed on your computer, install it.
* Then run in your terminal `$ gem install jekyll`
* Move/`cd` to a folder, always in your terminal, in which you want to insert the *Artists-Theme*
* Run `git clone https://github.com/triyanarief/artist-portfolio-websites.git`
* Then `cd artist-portfolio-websites`
* `jekyll serve --watch`
* **DONE**
